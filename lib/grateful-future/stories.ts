/**
 * Live seed for the Grateful Future tool.
 *
 * `loadStories()` is the ONE data seam (spec §9). It resolves the two real
 * research outputs the tool itself produced — Sagano and the Antikythera
 * "bronze lump" — baked to `seed-stories.json` so they show on the published
 * site, where the browser's localStorage starts empty. Stories created later
 * via the Create flow are layered on top from localStorage by the store.
 *
 * To go fully dynamic, swap the body for a live story-finder fetch — the UI
 * never changes, because the seed matches the real contract shape exactly
 * (lib/grateful-future/types.ts).
