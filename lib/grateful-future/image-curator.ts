 * Vision curation of the gathered image pool. A fast vision model LOOKS at
 * every candidate image alongside the story context and either:
 *  - keeps it, writing a truthful ~20-word description of what the image
 *    actually shows and how it relates to the research, or
 *  - drops it as unrelated (the X firehose especially returns ads, sports,
 *    charts, anime — anything the search term loosely co-occurred with).
 *
 * This runs server-side wherever images enter a story: the research engine's
 * pool build, "More from X", and the chat's image tools. Fail-open by design:
 * any failure (no API key, timeout, fetch errors) returns the images
 * untouched rather than blocking research.

THE STORY
Title: ${ctx.title}
${ctx.summary ? `Summary: ${ctx.summary}\n` : ""}${ctx.facts ? `Key facts:\n${ctx.facts}\n` : ""}
KEEP an image only if what it visibly shows relates to this story: the subject itself, its maker or place, the era or artifacts, faithful diagrams or reconstructions, relevant screenshots or posts ABOUT the subject. Atmospheric images are fine if clearly of the right subject matter.

DROP everything else without mercy: unrelated people, sports, ads, product shots, charts of other things, anime, memes about something else, logos, icons, blank or decorative frames. A loose keyword echo is not relevance. When unsure, drop.

For every KEPT image write a description of roughly 20 words: first what the image concretely shows (be specific and truthful — only what you can see), then how it connects to the story. Flat declarative tone, no hype, no em dashes.

Some images arrive with a published caption from their source page (shown in the hint). Treat it as ground truth: keep its names, dates, and specifics in your description instead of guessing — compress it, don't discard it. If what you SEE clearly contradicts the caption, trust your eyes.

Call submit_image_reviews exactly once with one entry per image.`;
