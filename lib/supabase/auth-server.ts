/**
 * Server-side Supabase auth client for the /admin surface.
 *
 * Uses @supabase/ssr's createServerClient so session cookies set by the
 * magic-link callback persist across requests. The publishable (anon)
 * key is fine here — the auth client only needs to read its own
 * session cookies and validate the user, not bypass RLS. Privileged
 * reads of the archive tables go through lib/supabase/admin.ts.
 *
 * The cookie adapter writes are wrapped in try/catch because Server
 * Components in Next.js 16 cannot mutate cookies during render — only
 * Server Actions and Route Handlers can. The auth helper silently
 * drops the write when called from a Server Component, matching the
 * pattern recommended in @supabase/ssr's docs.
